## XState (use @xstate/react)

XState is a state management library based on the concept of finite state machines (FSMs) and statecharts. It allows you to manage complex state logic in a predictable, declarative manner by modeling your appâ€™s states and transitions in a clear and structured way.

XState is particularly useful for managing workflows, component state, and business logic that involves multiple states and transitions, making it ideal for UI development, especially in React applications.
